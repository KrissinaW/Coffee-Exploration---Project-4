## *Description:*

This project leverages a comprehensive dataset of coffee, encompassing various categories such as type, cost, origin, flavor profile, and more, to build an interactive recommendation model. The model is designed to analyze consumer preferences entered into the system—such as desired taste, budget, and preferred coffee origin—and output personalized coffee recommendations. By utilizing advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, the model helps consumers discover new coffee varieties that align with their tastes and preferences, offering a unique, customized coffee-buying experience. 

## *Technologies Used:*

- Data Collection and Processing:

- Data Cleaning and Analysis:

- Machine Learning:

- Dashboard:

- Word Cloud:

 We created the word cloud by first selecting relevant text data column and then cleaning it by removing common stopwords, punctuation, and converting everything to lowercase for consistency. We then calculated the frequency of each word to determine its prominence in the word cloud. Using a word cloud generator, we input the processed text, adjusting the shape and colors to highlight key themes. The result visually represents the most frequent terms, allowing for a quick grasp of the main ideas within the dataset

- Final Project Presentation:

For the final presentation, we used Google Slides to organize and present our findings in a clear and visually engaging way.
